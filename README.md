# DESC-Lamp
DESC Lensing access and Machine learning Pipeline. This repo hosts the sections of the DESC and SLSC Strong Lensing (SL) pipeline that enable finding strong gravitational lens systems.

This is achieved by providing an interface that allows catalog-based preselection of lens candidates and that extract postage stamps of candidates. 

Another component of this pipeline makes use of the synthetic source injection capabilities developed by DM and used in DESC to inject synthetic gravitationally lensed sources. 
Synthetic injection of lensed sources is aimed at expanding training sets based on Rubin-quality data with real image characteristics. It is also aimed at providing a test and characterisation bench for lens finders.
